\f0\fs28 \cf0 NCIS: Gibbs\'92 Rules is in much need of an update. I have been working with fans of the show to update the content as I work on a complete overhaul of the app from the ground up. I will hopefully have a new version out by July this year. I am building the new version with a server component allowing fans to update quotes and content without me having to directly manage each content update.}
